# Unofficial FIFARosters.com mirror for AUGames
This mirror is in no way supported by FIFA Rosters, and will also not recieve any updates provided by FIFA Rosters. It runs on the website from 11/07/24. Source grabbed by HTTrack.

# What's the point?
The whole point of this repo is to provide a way to access the website disregarding blocking methods typically used by schools. This allows people to continue accessing the website. Any original tracking done by FIFA Rosters will also be sent though this website temporarily, while I am still grabbing all the source code.

# Security Issues
This repo in no way modifies any of the data collected by FIFA Rosters, if anything it should still send it to them. I am unsure on if the login function will still work as the server used by FIFA Rosters was also cloned while grabbing the source. None of the login data, form data or any other data is sent to me at all.

# Extra features
As of right now, I have no plans to include any extra features ontop of the source code and slight QOL features (such as removing ads) in this repo.

# How much is done?
As of right now, only around 20%, maybe 25%, has been grabbed by HTTrack. This project is already over 25gb in size and I had to remove a lot of crucial things in order to get it onto github. Progress will not be made until I can find a better solution for storing all the files.
